# ASP Search
ASP aka App Store Package Search is a script written in Python (why did it have to be snakes) that performs lookup actions of bundle IDs or Adam IDs against the Apple App Store and returns information about each app.

Much thanks to pug4N6 [for the original idea](https://github.com/pug4N6/bundleID_lookup) from which this drastically transformed out of.
